# Find the Index of the First Occurrence in a String

![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Easy-green)

## Problem

Given two strings needle and haystack, return the index of the first occurrence of needle in haystack, or -1 if needle is not part of haystack.

 
Example 1:

Input: haystack = "sadbutsad", needle = "sad"
Output: 0
Explanation: "sad" occurs at index 0 and 6.
The first occurrence is at index 0, so we return 0.


Example 2:

Input: haystack = "leetcode", needle = "leeto"
Output: -1
Explanation: "leeto" did not occur in "leetcode", so we return -1.


 
Constraints:


	1 <= haystack.length, needle.length <= 104
	haystack and needle consist of only lowercase English characters.

        int l=s.length();
        int l1=s1.length();

        if(l1>l)return -1;
